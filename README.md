These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

This is my 8th project, it might seem simple at first.

This project was useful for teaching be about touchscreen devices, on desktop to put a line-through an item on the list, you must click on it and if needed double-click to remove that line-through. On touchscreen devices browsers dont support double-click, so I had to advance my knowledge of pure JavaScript that must be used on touchscreen devices, I used touchmove this is an eventlistner() type that is used on touchscreen devices. This works by using x and y coordinate, I used these coordinates to remove the line-through any item and this is target dependent, .target is a new event property that returns the specific element, I could have used the indexes of the list to do the same task as .target, but exploring newer ways to execute a eventlistner function is always welcome.

Thanks for reading!
