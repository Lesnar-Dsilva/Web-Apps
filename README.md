This being my 3rd project, I thought I would do something basic such as JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM.

This is a simple background color generator, it flips between different colors using hexcodes, to convert a number to hexcode, I used the .toString(16) method the "16" arguement provided represents the total amount of values used to represent values, if the number is between 10 - 15 its going to be represented as A-F.

Thanks for reading!
