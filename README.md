# Web-Apps
This is my 4th JavaScript project, it uses non-primitive data types such as objects and array, these are used heavily because each carousel value represents a specific person. The person object contain their full name, job position and comment. The images are stored as a seperate array because I havent yet figured out how to contain that array within the object because accessing the Image variable is difficult.
I added two buttons and their corresponding functions, the inteesting thing I discovered with this and the Counter app is that increments need to be put at the highest order in the function otherwise the button needs to be clicked twice until the image changes.
I used Lorem Ipsum as the placeholder text, but this could be changed to any string in the comment array.

Thanks for reading!
