These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

Being my 9th project it carries on my general trend of using JS functions, eventlisteners() and variables, I didnt want this project to be complex.

In this project I learned about the CSS Flex display property it required messing around with it for hours. but I understood it using different online resources.

This is a simple calculator with no buttons except for the Calculate button, the user just needs to add the total bill and number of guests and the grade service drop-down menu (which uses the select HTML tag) is used as a multipler.

Thanks for reading!
