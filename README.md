These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

My 18th project is about a giveaway countdown.

In this project I learned about: 

-How to convert time from the normal string to milliseconds that can be used to multiply by 24(number of hours), 60(number of minutes), 60(number of seconds in a minute), 1000(number of milliseconds in a second), then dividing it from what point your at
e.g. if you at days you dont need to divide just multiply, or seconds just divide by the number of milliseconds.

It's a simple program I thought about building, it took 2 hours.

Thanks for reading!
