These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

The 13th project of JavaScript is based on the common FAQ pages were see around the Internet, I used the forEach() method, I nested a eventListener and another forEach() method within it.

forEach allowed for me to tackle the problem of dealing with multiple questions being present on the page, while the only difference in their content was their text (I used Lorem ipsum), hence the use of classes because a class can be assigned to different elements and doesn't have to be unique. I have had the forEach() method in my back pocket for a while now because I learnt about it during my month long CodeWars experience, but couldnt find the oppurtunity to use it until now.

Thanks for reading!
