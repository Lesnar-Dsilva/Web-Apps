This is my second project, which is a stopwatch

It's functionality is limited as I wasnt able to figure out how to stop and resume the time without overwriting the current time.

It functions as a basic stopwatch with a start button, which disappears when clicked because, if it was clicked again it would overwrite the current time.

The stop button is used to only stop the time if required, but then the time cant be resumed, and only the lap button and reset button are functional.

As a stopwatch runs through the time, it requires to be reset to 0 to stop the time from runnning further anymore. It allows the start button to reappear and erases any contents in the laps list.

Finally, the lap button is self explanatory as it records the current time at which the button was clicked, the maximum capacity is 15 otherwise it overflows outside the browser window, and if this limit is reached then it notifys the user that the maximum capacity has been reached.

This was second project required a lot more code to be written to be functional to my standards, but my knowledge of JavaScript is still growing, this project took me a total of 8 hours to complete.
