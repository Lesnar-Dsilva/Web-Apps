These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

I am ending my JavaScript learning process with something simple and easy to make.

This project took me 2 hours to make, but I did start the project over 3 times, because CSS was the biggest issue to tackle due to arranging the buttons and image slide because the images wont always scale very well to every screen, as I used images with different aspect ratios and resolutions. CSS was difficult, but I did find a way around it using grid and using the vh unit for sizing including rem unit.

JS was done in 10 minutes because it was simply just a counter, and an array which uses the counter as an index.

There were only 4 images used because this could be scaled to any number of images, by just adding their names to the array and also converting them to the  .jpeg format otherwise it will return an error in the console. The images only need to be located in the folder same as the index.html file.

Learning  JavaScript was important to me because I knew this was the next level of knowledge required to become a front-end developer, I mostly learnt it as a hobby because I enjoy to code in my free time, I will still keep my knowledge up to date by constantly working on codewars because it always had challenges that progressivly get more difficult, and I know I still have a lot of documentation to learn.

Thanks for reading!
