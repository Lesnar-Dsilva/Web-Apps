These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

My 12th project is a simple webpage with a modal overlay.

A modal overlay acts as a way to draw attention to important informationn, but it is also used for call-to-actions commonly being used to request user email addresses to recieve updates and newsletters.

Mine has no information in it, but it needed can fit anything from text to a form.

The challenge with this project was the background image, as well as positioning the modal overlay without altering the background image, which seemed to be affect by one or more properties during its creation. I used a fixed position because on any display I want it to always be around the center.

Thanks for reading!
