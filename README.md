The 11th project is a responsive sidebar.

I used the aside html element, this puts any elements contained within to one side of the page "aside" (pun intended) from the "main" content of the page.

This is a very similar project to the responsive navbar project, but this time I actually added transitions to make it smooth and also to demonstate a fraction of my CSS knowledge (its still growing).

I use the const variable decleration to call the toggle button element, the sidebar element and close button element.

I use a if and else statement to add and remove the ".hideSidebar" class from the ".sidebar" classList. I also could have used the toggle() method to add and remove the ".hideSidebar" class from the ".sidebar" class by using the toggle button, which could have made the code simpler.

Thanks for reading!
