# Web-Apps
These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

This is my 19th project, I thought I would tackle something used throught most designs "Lorem Ipsum", but this is too often used which can get stale and repetitive.

In this project I learned about:

parseInt()
.map()
isNaN()

I have learned about parseInt and .map() before, but I have forgetten about their use, because I most commonly only use .forEach() for every array I interact with. The purpose of parseInt() is used ot convert any number to an integer, because the HTML input element only returns a string value to JavaScript. The .map() method is used to manipulate every element in the array. The isNaN() method is used to evaluate whether the returned value is a number, or a string returning a boolean value, which is ideal for if statements.

This project took 1hr30mins to complete including fixing the structure displaying on smaller screen and large screens.

Thanks for reading!
