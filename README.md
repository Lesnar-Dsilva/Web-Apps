# Web-Apps
These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

This is my 15th JavaScript project.

This project's goal was simple: background video. I have noticed a few websites have video playing in the background of the webpage commonly at the top under the navigation menu.

I added a play and pause button, with a slide that moves between the two elements when the slides classlist is manipulated and using JavaScript eventListener method to add or remove this the "slide" class.

I also have now learnt about preloader gifs or video content, this is only shown when the whole content of the DOM has loaded from stylesheets to images, but only the preloader image is displayed until the whole DOM has been loaded.

Thanks for reading!
