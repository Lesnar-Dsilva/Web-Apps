These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

In this project, I used a conditional (ternary) operator to render the date (Date/Month/Year), this is a simpler way to write if statements, but the drawback is you can't write it without an else statement, the experssion after the colon ":" is only executed, if the former expression is false.

Switch statements were also used to return the day of the week, because getDay() only provides numerical values which you can then convert to a day of the week using an if statement or switch statement.

I used setInterval() to continually render the page, every second (1000ms) the function used in this method is used to render the page by manipulating the .innerHTML of every element in the DOM.

Thanks for reading!
