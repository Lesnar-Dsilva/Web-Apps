These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript

This is my 7th project it uses objects, because storing large quantities of quotes in arrays would have worked, but objects seems more difficult to access and handle compared to arrays because they have a large range of methods.

For the generate button I used an eventlistener and used an arrow function to achieve its required function.
