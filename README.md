These are my projects that involving using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript


This is my 11th JavaScript project.

This is a simple project, but its more responsive compared to my other projects, because it uses the flex display property. I have used a hamburger icon to indicate to the user that, if they click on it the menu will appear. This is where the JavaScript comes in, I use the classList property to add the .showLinks to the class of the ul tag of the links, and to remove the .showLinks class off the ul tag of the links. The JavaScript is much simple compared to my other project, I could have simplified this project by using the toggle() method to add or remove the .showLinks because of the eventListener linked to the hamburger icon.

Thank you for reading!
